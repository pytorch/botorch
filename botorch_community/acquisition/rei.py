Region Averaged Acquisition Functions for Efficient Trust Region Selection
for High-Dimensional Trust Region Bayesian Optimization.
See [eriksson2019TuRBO]_, [namura2024rei]_

Two versions of the Regional Expected Improvement (REI) acquisition
function are implemented here:
1. Analytic version: LogRegionalExpectedImprovement
2. Monte Carlo version: qLogRegionalExpectedImprovement

LogREI has been implemented from the original paper [namura2024rei]_
and code(https://github.com/Nobuo-Namura/regional-expected-improvement/)
and qLogREI have been implemented by slightly modifying the qREI
acquisition function implementation from the paper.

These acquisition functions can help explore the design space efficiently
since trust regions at initialization and restarts in algorithms like TuRBO
are selected by optimizing the Region Averaged Acquisition Functions instead
of sampling them randomly. This has displayed faster convergence in some cases
and convergence to better solutions in general as showed in [namura2024rei]_.
