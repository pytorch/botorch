    "In this tutorial notebook we demonstrate how to perform multi-objective multi-fidelity optimization in BoTorch using the multi-fidelity Hypervolume Knowledge Gradient (MF-HVKG) [3] and a method called Multi-Objective Multi-Fidelity (MOMF) [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "MF-HVKG performs one-step lookahead: it operates under the assumption that we can make one additional observation, and after receiving that additional observation, we will select the Pareto set of optimal designs. HVKG seeks to select the design `x` to evaluate that maximizes the value of information about the Pareto set by maximizing the hypervolume under the posterior mean (conditional on receiving on new observation for the design `x`).\n",
    "\n",
    "MOMF is an alternative approach that introduces an additional \"fidelity objective\" that is optimized along with the problem objectives. This fidelity objective can be thought of as a trust objective that rewards the optimization when going to higher fidelity. Thus, the MOMF explicitly optimizes for getting more high-fidelity (trustworthy) data while taking into account the higher computational costs associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "HVKG is generally more cost efficient [3], since it explicitly targets the goal of MF optimization: select design points and fidelities that enable identifying about the Pareto Frontier at the target fidelity in a cost-aware fashion. MOMF will typically result in faster candidate generation. If the application is high-throughput and requires fast candidate generation, MOMF will be preferable. Otherwise, MF-HVKG will likely give better sample efficiency and performance [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will optimize a synthetic function that is a modified multi-fidelity Branin-Currin [1]. This is a 3-dimesional, bi-objective problem with one of the input dimensions being the fidelity. For the MOMF, this results in a 3-objective problem since it also takes the fidelity objective into account. In this case the fidelity objective is a linear function of fidelity, $ f(s)=s$, where $s$ is the fidelity. The MOMF algorithm can accept any discrete or continuous cost functions as an input. In this example, we choose an exponential dependency of the form $C(s)=\\exp(4.8s)$. The goal of the optimization is to find the Pareto front, which is a trade-off solution set for Multi-objective problems, at the highest fidelity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: pymoo is an optional dependency that is used for determining the Pareto set of optimal designs under the model posterior mean using NSGA-II (which is not a sample efficient method, but sample efficiency is not critical for this step). If pymoo is not available, the Pareto set of optimal designs is selected from a discrete set. This will work okay for low-dim (e.g. \n",
    " dimensions) problems, but in general NSGA-II will yield far better results.\n",
