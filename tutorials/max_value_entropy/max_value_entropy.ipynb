        "\n",
        "Max-value entropy search (MES) acquisition function quantifies the information gain about the maximum of a black-box function by observing this black-box function $f$ at the candidate set $\\{\\textbf{x}\\}$ (see [1, 2]). BoTorch provides implementations of the MES acquisition function and its multi-fidelity (MF) version with support for trace observations. In this tutorial, we explain at a high level how the MES acquisition function works, its implementation in BoTorch and how to use the MES acquisition function to query the next point in the optimization process. \n",
        "\n",
        "In general, we recommend using [Ax](https://ax.dev) for a simple BO setup like this one, since this will simplify your setup (including the amount of code you need to write) considerably. You can use a custom BoTorch model and acquisition function in Ax, following the [Using BoTorch with Ax](/docs/tutorials/custom_botorch_model_in_ax) tutorial. To use the MES acquisition function, it is sufficient to add `\"botorch_acqf_class\": qMaxValueEntropy,` to `model_kwargs`. The linked tutorial shows how to use a custom BoTorch model. If you'd like to let Ax choose which model to use based on the properties of the search space, you can skip the `surrogate` argument in `model_kwargs`.\n",
