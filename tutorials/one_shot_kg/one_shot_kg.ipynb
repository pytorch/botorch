KG often shows improved Bayesian Optimization performance relative to simpler acquisition functions such as Expected Improvement, but in its traditional form it is computationally expensive and hard to implement.\n",

You can use a custom BoTorch model and acquisition function in Ax, following the [Using BoTorch with Ax](/docs/tutorials/custom_botorch_model_in_ax) tutorial. To use the KG acquisition function, it is sufficient to add `\"botorch_acqf_class\": qKnowledgeGradient,` to `model_kwargs`. The linked tutorial shows how to use a custom BoTorch model. If you'd like to let Ax choose which model to use based on the properties of the search space, you can skip the `surrogate` argument in `model_kwargs`.\n",

        "\n",
        "The conventional approach for optimizing parallel KG (where $g(\\xi) = \\xi$) is to apply stochastic gradient ascent, with each gradient observation potentially being an average over multiple samples. For each sample $i$, the inner optimization problem $\\max_{x_i \\in \\mathbb{X}} \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\xi^i \\mid \\mathcal{D}_{\\mathbf{x}}^i \\right]$ for the posterior mean is solved numerically. An unbiased stochastic gradient of KG can then be computed by leveraging the envelope theorem and the optimal points $\\{x_i^*\\}$. In this approach, every iteration requires solving numerous inner optimization problems, one for each outer sample, in order to estimate just one stochastic gradient.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"one-shot\" formulation of KG in BoTorch treats optimizing $\\alpha_{\\text{KG}}(\\mathbf{x})$ as an entirely deterministic optimization problem. It involves drawing $N_{\\!f} = $ `num_fantasies` fixed base samples $\\mathbf{Z}_f:= \\{ \\mathbf{Z}^i_f \\}_{1\\leq i \\leq N_{\\!f}}$ for the outer expectation, sampling fantasy data $\\{\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathbf{x}}^i(\\mathbf{Z}_f^i)\\}_{1\\leq i \\leq N_{\\!f}}$, and constructing associated fantasy models $\\{\\mathcal{M}^i(\\mathbf{Z}_f^i)\\}_{1 \\leq i \\leq N_{\\!f}}$. The inner maximization can then be moved outside of the sample average, resulting in the following optimization problem:\n",

In either case one is left with a deterministic optimization problem. \n",

        "The key difference from the envelope theorem approach is that we do not solve the inner optimization problem to completion for every fantasy point for every gradient step with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$. Instead, we solve the nested optimization problem jointly over $\\mathbf{x}$ and the fantasy points $\\mathbf{X}'$. The resulting optimization problem is of higher dimension, namely $(q + N_{\\!f})d$ instead of $qd$, but unlike the envelope theorem formulation it can be solved as a single optimization problem, which can be solved using standard methods for deterministic optimization. \n",
