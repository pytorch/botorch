r"""Gaussian Process Regression models with fully Bayesian inference.

Fully Bayesian models use Bayesian inference over model hyperparameters, such
as lengthscales and noise variance, learning a posterior distribution for the
hyperparameters using the No-U-Turn-Sampler (NUTS). This is followed by
sampling a small set of hyperparameters (often ~16) from the posterior
that we will use for model predictions and for computing acquisition function
values. By contrast, our “standard” models (e.g.
`SingleTaskGP`) learn only a single best value for each hyperparameter using
MAP. The fully Bayesian method generally results in a better and more
well-calibrated model, but is more computationally intensive. For a full
description, see [Eriksson2021saasbo].

We use a lightweight PyTorch implementation of a Matern-5/2 kernel as there are
some performance issues with running NUTS on top of standard GPyTorch models.
The resulting hyperparameter samples are loaded into a batched GPyTorch model
after fitting.

    This class and its subclasses are not a standard BoTorch models; instead
    the subclasses are used as inputs to a `SaasFullyBayesianSingleTaskGP`,
    which should then have its hyperparameters fit with
    `fit_fully_bayesian_model_nuts`. (By default, its subclass `SaasPyroModel`
    is used).  A `PyroModel`’s `sample` method should specify lightweight
    PyTorch functionality, which will be used for fast model fitting with NUTS.
    The utility of `PyroModel` is in enabling fast fitting with NUTS, since we
    would otherwise need to use GPyTorch, which is computationally infeasible
    in combination with Pyro.

                of the feature space and `q` is the number of points considered
                jointly.
            output_indices: A list of indices, corresponding to the outputs over
                which to compute the posterior (if the model is multi-output).
                Can be used to speed up computation if only a subset of the
                model's outputs are required for optimization. If omitted,
                computes the posterior over all model outputs.
            observation_noise: If True, add the observation noise from the
                likelihood to the posterior. If a Tensor, use it directly as the
                observation noise (must be of shape `(batch_shape) x q x m`).
            posterior_transform: An optional PosteriorTransform.

        Returns:
            A `FullyBayesianPosterior` object. Includes observation noise if specified.
