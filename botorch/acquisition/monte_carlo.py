class SampleReducingMCAcquisitionFunction(MCAcquisitionFunction):
    r"""MC-based batch acquisition function that reduces across samples and implements
    a general treatment of outcome constraints.

    This class's `forward` computes the - possibly constrained - acquisition value by
    (1) computing the unconstrained utility for each MC sample using `_sample_forward`,
    (2) weighing the utility values by the constraint indicator per MC sample, and
    (3) reducing (e.g. averaging) the weighted utility values over the MC dimension.

    NOTE: Do *NOT* override the `forward` method, unless you have thought about it well.

    `forward` is implemented generically to incorporate constraints in a principled way,
    and takes care of reducing over the Monte Carlo and batch dimensions via the
    `sample_reduction` and `q_reduction` arguments, which default to `torch.mean` and
    `torch.max`, respectively.

    In order to implement a custom SampleReducingMCAcquisitionFunction, we only need to
    implement the `_sample_forward(obj: Tensor) -> Tensor` method, which maps objective
    samples to acquisition utility values without reducing the Monte Carlo and batch
    (i.e. q) dimensions (see details in the docstring of `_sample_forward`).

    A note on design choices:

    The primary purpose of `SampleReducingMCAcquisitionFunction`is to support outcome
    constraints. On the surface, designing a wrapper `ConstrainedMCAcquisitionFunction`
    could be an elegant solution to this end, but it would still require the acquisition
    functions to implement a `_sample_forward` method to weigh acquisition utilities at
    the sample level. Further, `qNoisyExpectedImprovement` is a special case that is
    hard to encompass in this pattern, since it requires the computation of the best
    *feasible* objective, which requires access to the constraint functions. However,
    if the constraints are stored in a wrapper class, they will be inaccessible to the
    forward pass. These problems are circumvented by the design of this class.

            sampler: The sampler used to draw base samples. See `MCAcquisitionFunction`
                more details.
            objective: The MCAcquisitionObjective under which the samples are
                evaluated. Defaults to `IdentityMCObjective()`.
                NOTE: `ConstrainedMCObjective` for outcome constraints is deprecated in
                favor of passing the `constraints` directly to this constructor.
            posterior_transform: A PosteriorTransform (optional).
            X_pending: A `batch_shape x m x d`-dim Tensor of `m` design points
                that have points that have been submitted for function evaluation
                but have not yet been evaluated. Concatenated into `X` upon
                forward call. Copied and set to have no gradient.
            prune_baseline: If True, remove points in `X_baseline` that are
                highly unlikely to be the best point. This can significantly
                improve performance and is generally recommended. In order to
                customize pruning parameters, instead manually call
                `botorch.acquisition.utils.prune_inferior_points` on `X_baseline`
                before instantiating the acquisition function.
            cache_root: A boolean indicating whether to cache the root
                decomposition over `X_baseline` and use low-rank updates.
            constraints: A list of constraint callables which map a Tensor of posterior
                samples of dimension `sample_shape x batch-shape x q x m`-dim to a
                `sample_shape x batch-shape x q`-dim Tensor. The associated constraints
                are considered satisfied if the output is less than zero.
            eta: Temperature parameter(s) governing the smoothness of the sigmoid
                approximation to the constraint indicators. For more details, on this
                parameter, see the docs of `compute_smoothed_feasibility_indicator`.
            marginalize_dim: The dimension to marginalize over.

        TODO: similar to qNEHVI, when we are using sequential greedy candidate
        selection, we could incorporate pending points X_baseline and compute
        the incremental qNEI from the new point. This would greatly increase
        efficiency for large batches.

        Args:
            model: A fitted model.
            sampler: The sampler used to draw base samples. See `MCAcquisitionFunction`
                more details.
            objective: The MCAcquisitionObjective under which the samples are
                evaluated. Defaults to `IdentityMCObjective()`.
            posterior_transform: A PosteriorTransform (optional).
            X_pending: A `batch_shape x m x d`-dim Tensor of `m` design points that have
                points that have been submitted for function evaluation but have not yet
                been evaluated. Concatenated into X upon forward call. Copied and set to

                samples of dimension `sample_shape x batch-shape x q x m`-dim to a
                `sample_shape x batch-shape x q`-dim Tensor. The associated constraints
                are considered satisfied if the output is less than zero.
            eta: Temperature parameter(s) governing the smoothness of the sigmoid
                approximation to the constraint indicators. For more details, on this
                parameter, see the docs of `compute_smoothed_feasibility_indicator`.
