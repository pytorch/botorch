NOTE: On the default temperature parameters:

tau_relu: It is generally important to set `tau_relu` to be very small, in particular,
smaller than the expected improvement value. Otherwise, the optimization can stagnate.
By setting `tau_relu=1e-6` by default, stagnation is exceedingly unlikely to occur due
to the smooth ReLU approximation for practical applications of BO.
IDEA: We could consider shrinking `tau_relu` with the progression of the optimization.

tau_max: This is only relevant for the batch (`q > 1`) case, and `tau_max=1e-2` is
sufficient to get a good approximation to the maximum improvement in the batch of
candidates. If `fat=False`, the smooth approximation to the maximum can saturate
numerically. It is therefore recommended to use `fat=True` when optimizing batches
of `q > 1` points.

    over the `q` test points and previously observed points. A smooth approximation
    to the canonical improvement over previously observed points is computed
    for each sample and the logarithm of the average is returned.
