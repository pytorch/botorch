        r"""Parallel Log Expected Hypervolume Improvement supporting m>=2 outcomes.

        See [Ament2023logei]_ for details and the methodology behind the LogEI family of
        acquisition function. Line-by-line differences to the original differentiable
        expected hypervolume formulation of [Daulton2020qehvi]_ are described via inline
        comments in `forward`.

        Example:
            >>> model = SingleTaskGP(train_X, train_Y)
            >>> ref_point = [0.0, 0.0]
            >>> acq = qLogExpectedHypervolumeImprovement(model, ref_point, partitioning)
            >>> value = acq(test_X)

        Args:
            model: A fitted model.
            ref_point: A list or tensor with `m` elements representing the reference
                point (in the outcome space) w.r.t. to which compute the hypervolume.
                This is a reference point for the objective values (i.e. after
                applying`objective` to the samples).
            partitioning: A `NondominatedPartitioning` module that provides the non-
                dominated front and a partitioning of the non-dominated space in hyper-
                rectangles. If constraints are present, this partitioning must only
                include feasible points.
            sampler: The sampler used to draw base samples. If not given,
                a sampler is generated using `get_sampler`.
            objective: The MCMultiOutputObjective under which the samples are evaluated.
                Defaults to `IdentityMultiOutputObjective()`.
            constraints: A list of callables, each mapping a Tensor of dimension
                `sample_shape x batch-shape x q x m` to a Tensor of dimension
                `sample_shape x batch-shape x q`, where negative values imply
                feasibility. The acquisition function will compute expected feasible
                hypervolume.
            X_pending: A `batch_shape x m x d`-dim Tensor of `m` design points that have
                points that have been submitted for function evaluation but have not yet
                been evaluated. Concatenated into `X` upon forward call. Copied and set
                to have no gradient.
            eta: The temperature parameter for the sigmoid function used for the
                differentiable approximation of the constraints. In case of a float the
                same eta is used for every constraint in constraints. In case of a
                tensor the length of the tensor must match the number of provided
                constraints. The i-th constraint is then estimated with the i-th
                eta value.
            fat: Toggles the logarithmic / linear asymptotic behavior of the smooth
                approximation to the ReLU and the maximum.
            tau_relu: Temperature parameter controlling the sharpness of the
                approximation to the ReLU over the `q` candidate points. For further
                details, see the comments above the definition of `TAU_RELU`.
            tau_max: Temperature parameter controlling the sharpness of the
                approximation to the `max` operator over the `q` candidate points.
                For further details, see the comments above the definition of `TAU_MAX`.

        q-Log Noisy Expected Hypervolume Improvement supporting m>=2 outcomes.

        Based on the differentiable hypervolume formulation of [Daulton2021nehvi]_.

        Example:
            >>> model = SingleTaskGP(train_X, train_Y)
            >>> ref_point = [0.0, 0.0]
            >>> qNEHVI = qNoisyExpectedHypervolumeImprovement(model, ref_point, train_X)
            >>> qnehvi = qNEHVI(test_X)

        Args:
            model: A fitted model.
            ref_point: A list or tensor with `m` elements representing the reference
                point (in the outcome space) w.r.t. to which compute the hypervolume.
                This is a reference point for the objective values (i.e. after
                applying `objective` to the samples).
            X_baseline: A `r x d`-dim Tensor of `r` design points that have already
                been observed. These points are considered as potential approximate
                pareto-optimal design points.
            sampler: The sampler used to draw base samples. If not given,
                a sampler is generated using `get_sampler`.
                Note: a pareto front is created for each mc sample, which can be
                computationally intensive for `m` > 2.
            objective: The MCMultiOutputObjective under which the samples are
                evaluated. Defaults to `IdentityMultiOutputObjective()`.
            constraints: A list of callables, each mapping a Tensor of dimension
                `sample_shape x batch-shape x q x m` to a Tensor of dimension
                `sample_shape x batch-shape x q`, where negative values imply
                feasibility. The acquisition function will compute expected feasible
                hypervolume.
            X_pending: A `batch_shape x m x d`-dim Tensor of `m` design points that
                have points that have been submitted for function evaluation, but
                have not yet been evaluated.
            eta: The temperature parameter for the sigmoid function used for the
                differentiable approximation of the constraints. In case of a float the
                same `eta` is used for every constraint in constraints. In case of a
                tensor the length of the tensor must match the number of provided
                constraints. The i-th constraint is then estimated with the i-th
                `eta` value.
            prune_baseline: If True, remove points in `X_baseline` that are
                highly unlikely to be the pareto optimal and better than the
                reference point. This can significantly improve computation time and
                is generally recommended. In order to customize pruning parameters,
                instead manually call `prune_inferior_points_multi_objective` on
                `X_baseline` before instantiating the acquisition function.
            alpha: The hyperparameter controlling the approximate non-dominated
                partitioning. The default value of 0.0 means an exact partitioning
                is used. As the number of objectives `m` increases, consider increasing
                this parameter in order to limit computational complexity.
            cache_pending: A boolean indicating whether to use cached box
                decompositions (CBD) for handling pending points. This is
                generally recommended.
            max_iep: The maximum number of pending points before the box
                decompositions will be recomputed.
            incremental_nehvi: A boolean indicating whether to compute the
                incremental NEHVI from the `i`th point where `i=1, ..., q`
                under sequential greedy optimization, or the full qNEHVI over
                `q` points.
            cache_root: A boolean indicating whether to cache the root
                decomposition over `X_baseline` and use low-rank updates.
            marginalize_dim: A batch dimension that should be marginalized.
