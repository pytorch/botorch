    """A wrapper around AcquisitionFunctions to add proximal weighting of the
    acquisition function. The acquisition function is
    weighted via a squared exponential centered at the last training point,
    with varying lengthscales corresponding to `proximal_weights`. Can only be used
    with acquisition functions based on single batch models. Acquisition functions
    must be positive or `beta` must be specified to apply a SoftPlus transform before
    proximal weighting.

    Small values of `proximal_weights` corresponds to strong biasing towards recently
    observed points, which smoothes optimization with a small potential decrese in
    convergence rate.



    Example:
        >>> model = SingleTaskGP(train_X, train_Y)

        >>> proximal_weights = torch.ones(d)
