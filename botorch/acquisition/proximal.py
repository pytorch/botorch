    acquisition function. Acquisition function is weighted via a squared exponential
    centered at the last training point, with varying lengthscales corresponding to
    `proximal_weights`. Can only be used with acquisition functions based on single
    batch models.

    Small values of `proximal_weights` corresponds to strong biasing towards recently
    observed points, which smoothes optimization with a small potential decrese in
    convergence rate.

    Example:
        >>> model = SingleTaskGP(train_X, train_Y)
        >>> EI = ExpectedImprovement(model, best_f=0.0)
        >>> proximal_weights = torch.ones(d)
